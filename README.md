<h1> Azure SIEM Lab (Guided Project)</h1>


<h2>Project overview:</h2>

This project is based on a guided walkthrough I followed to gain hands-on experience creating a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution in **Microsoft Azure** using Microsoft Sentinel.

## 1. Setting up the Environment
- Created a **Resource Group** in Azure to hold project resources  
- Deployed a **Virtual Network** to host the VM  
- Created a **Windows 10 Pro Virtual Machine**  
- Configured NSG and firewall rules for any source to try remote login
